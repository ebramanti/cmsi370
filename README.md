CMSI 370: Interaction Design
============================

My personal work from Interaction Design, a course I took during my fall semester in 2013.  

### Objectives and Outcomes

Some critical information from the syllabus below:

This course explores the computer science subfield of interaction design (IxD), a.k.a. computer-human (or human-computer) interaction (CHI/HCI). Interaction Design is the study of how human beings interact with computing systems, providing measures for its effectiveness, and discovering techniques and theories for achieving effective interaction. Long after you finish this course, my hope is that you will be able to:

1. Appreciate and express the art and science of interaction design, including its theories, principles, methodologies, and role in software design and development.

2. Understand and report on how humans behave and interact with the user interfaces of real-world systems and software.

3. Demonstrate the fundamentals behind designing and implementing user interface.

4. Follow academic and technical best practices throughout the course.

### Assignments

#### Usability Study

The objective of this assignment was to gain experience with collecting usability measurements and assessing how well a device or system complies with its associated guidelines document.

For this assignment, I chose to do a comparison of shopping websites: Amazon, eBay, and Shopzilla. I conducted a usability study, collecting metrics based on interaction design principles, and wrote a heuristic evaluation on how to improve each website's usability.

#### RPG

The objective of this assignment was to put together a front end for a hypothetical role-playing game. The first part of the assignment was to focus on layout, navigation, and appearance. The second part of the assignment was to connect my web front end to the role-playing game web service API, Diabolical.

For this assignment, I designed a layout for a Skyrim character creator in Bootstrap 3. After that, I used Ajax calls to implement the Diabolical backend into my RPG Character Creator.

#### Mental Model Paper

The objective of this assignment was to write a mental model research and analysis paper.

My subject was the “Mobile OS User Experience Shootout” from Pfeiffer Consulting.

"With the recent release of iOS 7, a consulting company called Pfeiffer Consulting released what it calls a “user experience shootout” among mobile operating systems. This “shootout” appears to be similar in spirit to the usability studies that you have performed recently, except with different metrics and methods. For this topic, you are asked to examine the final report and critically assess its metrics, methods, and results based on what you have seen (and experienced) in class."

#### Direct Manipulation

The objective of this assignment was to gain firsthand experience in implementing direct manipulation. 

I successfully implemented a program, boxes-touch, with touch creation, relocation, and deletion, with some initial skeleton code provided.

#### JQuery Widget from Scratch

The objective of this assignment was to design and implement a reusable widget for use in web browsers in general, and for my role-playing game user interface in particular. To emphasize reusability, I implemented my widget as a jQuery plug-in.

For this assignment, I designed an in-place text editor for editing attributes of a RPG character. When a user requested an edit on a specific character, it would provide their current values, and upon hover would highlight a Bootstrap "edit" glyphicon. I had to additionally implement a function that would pull data from the Diabolical server so attributes were editable.

#### Dream Design

The objective of this assignment was to design your idea of a “dream” user interface for a selected system. My design had to include the following:
1. A top-level design or layout
2. At least two usage scenarios
3. Rationale for your design: relevant priorities, mental models, interaction design concepts, guidelines, principles, theories, etc.
4. Usability metric “forecast” analysis of your de- sign—if implemented then tested, what would be your design’s strong metrics? Weak metrics? Explain your choices.

For this assignment, I wrote a dream interface for real-time strategy implementation on mobile platforms. Taking inspiration from games such as Halo Wars, I came up with a hypothetical interface that follows the design principles of mobile devices. The goal was to maintain usability and account for limited screen space/touch interface.
